    Magnum UI keeps on following changes for Horizon's
    AngularJS-based framework. So we can use recent
    Horizon's feature. And hundreds of JavaScript tests
    are added. This ensures quality of Magnum UI.
features:
  - >
    Allow to create cluster template without keypair.
    Also, allow change or set keypair in cluster creation.
    Following change in Magnum, also Magnum UI allows this
    feature.
  - >
    Change creation actions to global actions. Cluster
    Template creation and Cluster creation actions are
    changed from batchAction to globalAction. This means
    these actions are callable from other panels.
  - >
    Use initAction() instead initScope(). initScope() is
    deprecated from Horizon in Ocata and will be removed
    in Queens.
  - >
    Use horizon's common "views" module for Angular. This
    proceeds independence against Django framework for
    plugins.
  - Reasonable name is set to browser title bar.
